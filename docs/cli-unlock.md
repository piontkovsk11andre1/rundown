# CLI: `unlock`

Manually remove a stale per-source lockfile (`<source-dir>/.rundown/<basename>.lock`) for a Markdown source.

`unlock` is a safety command for lock recovery. It only removes locks that are not owned by a currently running process.

## Global option: `--config-dir <path>`

`--config-dir <path>` is available on every command.

- If provided, rundown uses that directory as the `.rundown` config root and skips upward discovery.
- If omitted, rundown discovers `.rundown/` by walking upward from the command start directory until it finds one.
- If discovery finds nothing, command-specific fallback behavior applies.

Synopsis:

```bash
rundown unlock <source>
```

Arguments:

- `<source>`: Markdown source file used to resolve the lock path.

Options:

- None.

Path resolution:

- `unlock <source>` resolves the lockfile at `<source-dir>/.rundown/<basename>.lock` (source-relative lock path).
- `unlock` does not resolve lockfiles under `<config-dir>/locks/`.

Behavior:

- If no lockfile exists for the source, exits `3`.
- If a lockfile exists and the recorded PID is still running, exits `1` and does not remove the lock.
- If a lockfile exists but the recorded PID is not running (stale lock), removes it and exits `0`.

Examples:

```bash
rundown unlock roadmap.md
rundown unlock docs/todos.md
```
